## Changelog

### Version 0.5.3

#### Improvements
- Added **detailed error logging** to the console if fetching the trusted or unsafe site lists fails. Errors now show the failing URL and full response object.
- Added a **console log summary** showing how many **safe** and **unsafe** domains were successfully loaded from FMHY.

These changes improve transparency and make troubleshooting easier if FMHY's lists ever go down or change format.

---




### Version 0.5.2

This update further enhances **FMHY SafeLink Guard**, refining its user controls, improving flexibility, and adding new limits to prevent visual clutter. Version 0.5.2 gives users **full control over trusted and untrusted domains** directly from the settings menu, prioritizes personal overrides over FMHY‚Äôs lists, and makes the script smarter when handling multiple links to the same domain. Bugs are removed.

---

### New Features

#### User-Controlled Trusted & Untrusted Domains
- The settings panel now includes two **editable lists**:
    - **Trusted Domains** ‚Äì Sites the user trusts, even if FMHY lists them as unsafe.
    - **Untrusted Domains** ‚Äì Sites the user wants flagged as unsafe, even if FMHY lists them as trusted.
- These lists are **persistently saved** using Tampermonkey‚Äôs `GM_setValue`, so they remain even after browser restarts.

#### Override Logic
- **User overrides take full priority**:
    - If a domain is in the **Trusted Domains**, it will always be treated as safe (green highlight if enabled), even if FMHY marks it unsafe.
    - If a domain is in the **Untrusted Domains**, it will always be treated as unsafe (red highlight and/or warning banner if enabled), even if FMHY lists it as trusted.

#### Redesigned Settings Panel
- The settings panel has been expanded and restyled.
- Trusted and Untrusted lists are fully editable in the panel.
- Icons (üü¢üî¥‚ö†Ô∏è) provide better visual clarity for each setting.

### Version 0.5.1

This update introduces significant improvements to FMHY SafeLink Guard, evolving it from a simple unsafe link banner into a comprehensive link management and highlighting tool. The script now supports both unsafe and trusted domains, adds color-coded link highlighting, and includes a settings menu for full user control.

### New Features

### Dual Source Protection
- The script now imports **both**:
    - `sitelist.txt` containing unsafe sites.
    - `fmhy_in_bookmarks.html` containing trusted sites.
- This enables the script to distinguish between trusted and unsafe sites.

### Visual Highlights
- Trusted sites from `fmhy_in_bookmarks.html` are highlighted with a **green glow**.
- Unsafe sites from `sitelist.txt` are highlighted with a **red glow**.
- These visual indicators provide clear, instant feedback about link safety.

### Improved Warning Banner
- The warning banner (`‚ö†Ô∏è FMHY Unsafe Site`) is still only shown **once per domain**, reducing unnecessary repetition.
- The banner works independently of the red highlighting, meaning you can choose to disable the red glow while keeping the banner active.

### Settings Menu !
- A settings panel can now be accessed directly from the Tampermonkey/Violentmonkey user script menu.
- In the settings panel, users can toggle the following options individually:
    - Highlight Trusted Links (green glow)
    - Highlight Unsafe Links (red glow)
    - Show Warning Banner for Unsafe Sites
- Changes take effect immediately after refreshing the page.

### Automatic List Updates
- The trusted and unsafe domain lists are still fetched directly from FMHY‚Äôs GitHub each time the script runs, ensuring users always receive up-to-date data.

### Version 0.4.2

#### List Source Change
- Switched to FMHY‚Äôs `sitelist.txt` instead of `filterlist.txt`.
- `filterlist.txt` was originally designed for uBlock Origin and included adblock-specific syntax like `||` and `^`. This was unnecessary for a userscript.
- `sitelist.txt` is a cleaner, domain-only list maintained by FMHY specifically for general-purpose use.

#### Simpler Parsing Logic
- Parsing code is now cleaner since `sitelist.txt` is just a plain list of domains, no extra parsing logic required.

#### Internal Improvements
- Fetching and parsing were improved to match the new format.
- Behavior stays the same: one warning per domain per page.

---

## Known Issues

- On pages that load large amounts of content dynamically, you might briefly see unflagged links until the script scans and updates them.
- Performance is generally very smooth, but extremely long or complex pages may cause minor delays.

---

## Disclaimer

FMHY SafeLink Guard relies entirely on the FMHY sitelist as its data source. This list is maintained by the FMHY community, not the script author. No warranty is provided, and the author accepts no liability for missed warnings or incorrect flags. Always apply your own judgment when visiting unfamiliar websites.
